iXu 3D Box
==========

The files in this folder were used to create the 3D Box image of iXu, as shown
on iXu’s website. But I’ve also created some alternative images (with either
black or white background, and in different sizes) for third-party website
reviews and linking.

The 3D Box image was created using the commercial software **Box Shot 3D**
(whatever its version was at the time of 2010). **Box Shot 3D** is now a retired
product, substituted by its successor, **Boxshot 4**—but it’s still available
for download at boxshot.com. I’ve left here the two Box Shot 3D project files
(`*.box3d`), but you’ll need **Box Shot 3D** to open them—I’m not sure if
**Boxshot 4** is backward compatible.
